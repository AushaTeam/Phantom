# Phantom
Phantom is my personal Discord bot written with [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) aimed at replacing the functionality of other major Discord bots!

## Requirements
- A Linux or macOS PC
    - Windows is untested

## Setup
To locally host, follow these steps:

0. Create a [Discord Bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).
    - Under the bot menu, make sure to enable the 'Server Members Intent'.

1. Install the required Python libraries:
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

2. Set the `PHANTOM_TOKEN` environment variable to your bot token.

3. Run `bot.py`:
`python3 bot.py`

## Invite
Phantom can be invited into any Discord server using [this](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=736756253333913670&permissions=1279257670&scope=bot) link.
